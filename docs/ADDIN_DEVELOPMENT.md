# Developing the VCS add-in through MCP

Contributor procedures for the add-in itself. User database sync and recovery
live in [AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md](AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md).

## Rebuilding the VCS add-in

To rebuild `Version Control.accda` from source after editing add-in files, do **not** use `vcs_rebuild_database` (that rebuilds a user project). Call:

```python
vcs_rebuild_addin(r"C:\path\to\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda.src")
```

The tool derives the development copy beside that folder, launches
`RebuildAddIn`, and passes its HTTP callback identity through the disconnected
worker to the builder Access process. Detailed `Log.Add` / `Log.Progress`
messages stream during the build; the status file covers compile, install, and
durable terminal recovery. Do **not** poll it yourself in the normal workflow.
`vcs_call_vba(..., ["RebuildAddIn", source])` remains launch-only.

MCP progress notifications are best-effort in Cursor 3.13 (often only "Running..." until the tool returns). For guaranteed live output, run `msaccess-vcs rebuild-addin <source>` from a terminal and keep that command in the foreground so the stream stays in the primary chat. The CLI exits when the operation reaches terminal status; that process exit is the completion signal. Do not background the CLI just to wait on a notification, and do not add a second timer wait, sleep, or `rebuild-status.json` poll after it has already finished.

`refused` and `launch-failed` are returned immediately and mean nothing was rebuilt: before launch, and inside the Access gate so nothing can reopen the file in between, the server closes Access windows **it created** that hold a file the rebuild replaces — including instances whose only claim on the add-in is having loaded it as a library. `refused` when a **user-owned** `MSACCESS.EXE` still holds one of those files or cannot be asked which files it holds (`otherInstances` names what to close; the add-in never closes another process), and `launch-failed` when the helper script never started, which leaves Access open and is safe to retry.

If a client times out (`-32001`) or the tool returns `rebuild_stalled` / `timeout`, recover by reading `<source>/logs/rebuild-status.json` and matching `phaseStarted` against `rebuild_phase_started`. A `complete` whose `phaseStarted` predates the call is an earlier run's record. After any client timeout, call `vcs_get_recent_calls()` before inferring from the status file. A live rebuild always has `MSACCESS.EXE` or `wscript.exe`; neither, with a non-terminal status, means the run died.

## Running the add-in's own tests

Prepare a **fresh disposable complete development host** according to the add-in
[test-host lifecycle](../../msaccess-vcs-addin/docs/agent-test-runs.md#prepare-and-dispose-of-the-entire-development-host).
It owns supported source-built closed-binary provenance, retained fixtures,
identity-confirmed owned close/fresh reopen, independent compilation/readability,
evidence preservation and whole-host disposal. Pass that prepared host as `database_path`:

```python
vcs_run_tests(r"C:\scratch\addin-suite\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda", "clsTestInstall")
```

A run needs two projects and they are different files: the installed add-in loads as a library and supplies the runner and `TestAssert`, while the code under test is whatever the current database holds. The runner scans the current VBA project, so the host decides which tests are found — aim a run at a user database, or anything in the repo's `Testing` folder, and you get that database's tests reported as a clean pass.

The installed add-in is refused as a host (see [installed-target protection](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-installed-add-in-is-never-a-target)); it also has no source tree beside it for the tests that read one. The add-in refuses such a run itself in `ExecuteTests` via `modInstall.CurrentDbIsInstalledAddIn`, so the server's refusal is the earlier of two.

`AccessConnection` opens the development copy itself (Access refuses to bind a file moniker to an `.accda`, so `GetObject` fails and the explicit `OpenCurrentDatabase` fallback in `_open_as_current_database` takes over), so no manual pre-open is needed.

MCP progress notifications are best-effort in Cursor. For live per-test output, run `msaccess-vcs run-tests <database>` from a terminal and keep that command in the foreground, the same way as `rebuild-addin`. The CLI prints pytest-style dots for fast passes, names tests that take a second or more, then a human completion line; it does not dump the full `tests` map. Headless means no add-in UI, not a hidden Access window.

## Assertion routing

Run these tests through the MCP server rather than from the development add-in's
own window. `modTestAssert.TestAssert` routes through `Application.Run` to the
installed add-in, while the runner singleton lives in the project receiving
`RunTests`. An in-project development-copy run separates them, discards assertions,
and reports every test as EMPTY. Treat all-EMPTY as a broken harness, not a pass.

These host rules apply to the add-in's own suite. A user-project test run targets
the user's database; see [access-vcs-sync verification](../skills/access-vcs-sync/references/verification.md).
